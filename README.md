# Usage
The height of the bars represent the number of countries that have a median age within the range specified on the bottom (x-axis). Adjust the slide on the bottom to adjust the number of bars.

Put your mouse pointer over each bar to see the specific countries and their corresponding median age.

# Bugs
* Putting mouse over each bar will result in a tooltip that max exceed the screen size if there are too many countries in that bar.
